# Decoding Project

## Course Project - CS 101 - Computer Programming and Utilization - Autumn Semester 2021 - Indian Institute of Technology Bombay 
### Course Instructor - Prof. Akshay S

The basic problem statement is to find the encryption key used in encrypting the input message. Moreover, it is also given the key is encrypted in such a way that the first 6 letters of the key (A-F), make up a real English word (called magic word in this context). And to aid us with the project, we are given a dictionary.txt file having around 10,000 mostly used words. The problem is to be solved using ETAI strategy and Dictionary closure.
(READ THE PROBLEM_STATEMENT.pdf for in depth explanation)

The code can be updated and to be made such that we can even show the real message, but to maintain the authenticity of the course project, I am leaving the code as was submitted, along with a autograder.py which makes an output file, and checks it with the input file for a total of 7 test cases (of which I have uploaded 3)
